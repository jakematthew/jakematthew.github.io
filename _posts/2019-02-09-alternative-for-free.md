<p>The most well-known dummy text is the 'Lorem Ipsum', which is
  said to have originated in the 16th century. Lorem Ipsum is composed in a pseudo-Latin
  language which more or less corresponds to 'proper' Latin. It contains a series of real
  Latin words. This ancient dummy text is also incomprehensible, but it imitates the
  rhythm of most European languages in Latin script. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> There are many variations of passages of Lorem
    Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected
    humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The advantage of its Latin origin and the relative meaninglessness of
  Lorum Ipsum is that the text does not attract attention to itself or distract the
  viewer's attention from the layout.</p>
